ScoreKeeper
written by Jesse Lovitt

A simple score keeping application for educational games.  This program is intended to be run alongside powerpoint or some other presentation or educational software.  It has been designed to take up as little screen space a possible so the educational questions or game have adequete space and is therefore not inherently user friendly.  There is however a brief getting started document covering the basics. 

The application can be run by simply downloading the scorekeeper.jar file and running:
	java -jar scorekeeper.jar
from the folder to which the jar file was saved.
